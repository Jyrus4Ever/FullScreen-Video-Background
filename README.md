# FullScreen Video Background
FullScreen Video Background using HTML &amp; CSS
In this repository, I've created 3 files. The first is a basic video background, In the second one, I've added some user interaction in it and In the third file I've included a YouTube video as a background video. All of them are responsive. I've mentioned some additional stuff when trying to made a video in the background responsive. Additionally I've mentioned some basic YouTube customization while trying to embed a YouTube Video in the background. 

## The first one: The basic FullScreen Video Background
This is the basic fullscreen video background that's mostly included in the header of a webpage. I've included some basic heading, description and a button. I've also included an overlay above the video background.
